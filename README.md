Metal with care

# MetalSmith-Demo

A working static site generator using [MetalSmith](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith).

## Why does this repo exist?

I was able to ramp up quickly thanks to Robin Thrift's getting-to-know-metalsmith series.. 
but the tutorial for [part 1 (from April 2014)](http://www.robinthrift.com/posts/metalsmith-part-1-setting-up-the-forge/) is already 
outdated. I am just starting to toy around with MetalSmith, but I figured I would create this as a starter project to help myself, 
and others like me, to Metal with care.

## Dependencies

1. git
2. node
3. npm

## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:SgtPooki/MetalSmith-Demo.git destinationDirectory
cd destinationDirectory
npm install
node index
```
